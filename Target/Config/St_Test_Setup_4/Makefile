# The include directory used when building user mode libraries

# it's typically /usr/include. If you're doing cross
# development, select the include directory of your cross
# compiler. Leave it blank if your compiler doesn't need this
# setting.

# LIN_USR_INC_DIR

# Define whether to build/use static or shared user state
