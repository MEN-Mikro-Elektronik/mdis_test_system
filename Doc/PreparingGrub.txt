To boot a particular OS with GRUB we need to make GRUB read configuration from
file at run time. Follow below steps in order to do that.

1. GRUB script
Create the grub script file "/etc/grub.d/99_men".
Add executable permisions to the file:
# chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/99_men
Add this content to the file:
--start of file--
#!/usr/bin/env bash

UUID=e8dca0bb-40f4-4f46-84d5-5db6caad5f50
CONF=boot.cfg

cat <<EOF
insmod ext2
search --set data --fs-uuid ${UUID}
if [ -f (\$data)/${CONF} ]; then
	source (\$data)/${CONF}
fi
EOF
--end of file--

The UUID variable is the partition UUID where the configuration file is
located. Use blkid to find a partition.
The CONF variable is the path to the configuration file on UUID partition.

2. GRUB flat menu
Open "/etc/default/grub" file.
Add this line to the file:
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=y

3. GRUB configuration file
Create the configuration file "/media/tests/boot.cfg".
Add this content to the file:
--start of file--
set timeout_style=menu
set timeout=30
set default=0
--end of file--

The timeout_style variable is a style of boot. Set it to menu to show the menu
or set it to hidden to hide the menu.
The timeout variable is a timeout in seconds after the OS is booted. Set it to
-1 to disable timeout or set it to 0 to boot immediately.
The default variable is the name of the OS to boot. It is the name of a menu
entry.

4. Update GRUB
Update GRUB configuration:
# update-grub
