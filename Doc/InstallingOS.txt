The system should be configured as it is described below:

1. Disable automatic update,
        CentOS:
        # To check if updates are turned on:
         systemctl status packagekit
        # To disable updates:
         systemctl stop packagekit
         systemctl mask packagekit
2. Check if network interface is enabled after power on by default (on CentOS it is not),
3. Check if /usr/local/bin is added to secure_path (on CentOS it is not),
        # sudo visudo
        # Defaults secure_path=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
4. Check time,
        CentOS:
        # Install and use ntp:
         yum install ntp
         chkconfig ntpd on
         ntpdate pool.ntp.org
         service ntpd start 
5. Set to ask sudo password every time,
        Ubuntu, CentOS:
        # sudo visudo
        # Defaults env_reset
        # Defaults env_reset, timestamp_timeout=0
6. Allow to log in as root via ssh,
        CentOS:
        # Make sure that password for root is "men". During install CentOs
        # require password to be at least 8 characters.
        Ubuntu:
        # Open: /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
        # Add just below line: 
        # PermitRootLogin without-password
         PermitRootLogin yes
        # Set root password:
         sudo passwd
        # Restart SSH service
         sudo service ssh restart:
7. Below packages have to be installed on System:
        python
        openssh-server
        sshpass
8. Run ansible playbook on Jenkins/Remote pc that will run tests:
        # Installing ansible:
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
         sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
         sudo apt-get install ansible
        # Check if addresses of devices are correct in inventory file
         ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
        # To add new packages to install edit roles/defaults/main.yml
