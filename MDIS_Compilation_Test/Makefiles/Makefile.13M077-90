# TARGET_TREE

# The directory of the kernel tree used for your target's

# building the kernel modules.

# RTAI applications

# The include directory used when building user mode libraries
# and applications. If you're doing selfhosted development,
# it's typically /usr/include. If you're doing cross
# development, select the include directory of your cross
# compiler. Leave it blank if your compiler doesn't need this
# setting.

# LIN_USR_INC_DIR

# Define whether to build/use static or shared user state
# libraries. In "static" mode, libraries are statically linked
# to programs. In "shared" mode, programs dynamically link to
# the libraries. "shared" mode makes programs smaller but
# requires installation of shared libraries on the target

# relative to your cross compilers lib directory.
